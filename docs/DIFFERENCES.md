# Differences from `survey-react-ui` (the official web renderer)

`@iotashan-llc/react-native-survey-library` renders the same SurveyJS
`SurveyModel`/theme JSON as `survey-react-ui`, unmodified. Most surveys
look and behave identically. This file documents the places where React
Native's platform (no DOM, no browser chrome, a stricter security
posture) forces observably different behavior — each entry says what
changed, why, and the workaround/migration path if one exists.

This is a living document seeded by task 0.9 (HTML/rich-text security);
later tasks (see `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, "Won't support in v1")
add their own entries as they land. Entries are grouped by the feature
area they affect, newest additions at the bottom of each section.

## HTML / rich-text rendering (task 0.9)

SurveyJS lets survey JSON carry HTML in several places (question/panel/
page `description`, `title` via `hasHtml`, the `html` question,
`completedHtml`/`loadingHtml`/`completedHtmlOnCondition`, etc.). Web
renders that HTML with the real browser DOM. This library renders it
through `<SanitizedHtml>` (`src/components/SanitizedHtml.tsx`), a
security-first adapter over `@native-html/render` — necessarily more
restrictive than a browser, by design.

### Tag support is an explicit allowlist, not "any HTML"

Web accepts arbitrary HTML — any tag, any nesting, any browser-supported
feature. This library only renders a fixed tag set: `p div span br hr h1
h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 ul ol li blockquote pre code strong b em i u s sub sup
table thead tbody tr td th a img` (plus `mark small del ins` when the
consuming component opts into `relaxedFormatting`).

- A tag outside the allowlist that isn't specifically dangerous (e.g.
  `<article>`, `<figure>`) is **unwrapped**: the tag itself disappears
  but its text/allowed-descendant content is kept in place.
- A fixed set of dangerous/foreign/raw-text elements (`svg math
  foreignObject template noscript meta link base style script iframe
  object embed form input textarea select button`, plus comments,
  doctypes, CDATA, and processing instructions) is **dropped as a whole
  subtree** — none of their content, including nested text, survives.

**Workaround:** author survey HTML using only the allowlisted tags for
content that must render on RN. There is no per-survey opt-out.

### No inline CSS (`style` attribute stripped unconditionally)

Web renders an element's `style` attribute as authored. This library
strips `style` on every element, always — there is no CSS property/value
allowlist in v1 (documented as a deliberate fidelity loss; a future,
separately-scoped allowlisted CSS parser — no `url()`, no imports — is
recorded but not built). Other attributes follow a minimal, functional
per-tag allowlist (e.g. `<a href>`, `<img src alt width height>`,
`<td>`/`<th>` `colspan`/`rowspan`) — attributes like `class`/`id`/
`onclick`/`data-*` are always dropped; there is no class-based styling
layer in this renderer for `class` to hook into anyway.

**Workaround:** move visual styling for HTML-bearing text into the
survey's Theme JSON (which this library does honor) rather than
per-element inline `style`.

### Links never auto-navigate — host app must opt in

Web's native `<a href>` navigates the browser directly on click/tap.
`<SanitizedHtml>` never calls `Linking.openURL` (or any navigation API)
itself. With no `onLinkPress` prop supplied, a press is silently a
no-op (plus a dev-only diagnostic); with one supplied, it receives the
**policy-revalidated canonical URL** and the host app decides what to do
(open in-app, open externally, ask the user, block it, etc.).

**Workaround:** always pass `onLinkPress` to `<SanitizedHtml>` (or, once
task 1.6/M1 wire the survey-level renderer, the corresponding `<Survey>`
prop) if link presses inside HTML content should do anything at all.

### URL scheme/origin policy is restrictive by default

Web has no equivalent restriction — the browser will request whatever
URL the page references. This library validates every URL through a
central scheme/origin policy (`src/security/uri-policy.ts`) before it
ever reaches a sink:

- Anchor `href` (event-only, human-mediated): a broader scheme set
  (`https http mailto tel`), no origin restriction.
- `<img src>` inside HTML content, and the other automatic-fetch
  contexts this policy also governs (survey/background images, video,
  `choicesByUrl` — wired by later tasks): `https:` only by default, and
  **no origin is fetchable until explicitly allowlisted** — IP-literal
  hosts, `localhost`/`.local`/private-range hosts, URL-embedded
  credentials, and non-default ports (unless that exact origin+port is
  allowlisted) are denied even for an allowlisted host on the wrong
  port. `data:` images are supported under a strict rule (allowlisted
  MIME types, strict base64, a decoded-size cap, magic-byte
  verification) — no other `data:` use is ever permitted.
- `javascript: vbscript: file: about: blob: filesystem: intent: content:
  jar:` are denied everywhere, unconditionally — no configuration can
  widen this set.

**Workaround:** pass `imageUriConfig.allowedOrigins` (and, once wired at
the `<Survey>` level, per-survey origin configuration) listing every
origin the survey's images/assets are actually served from. Without it,
`<img>` tags inside HTML content render without a source.

### Oversized/pathological HTML renders as plain text, not a partial DOM

Web will attempt to render arbitrarily large or deeply-nested HTML.
This library enforces resource bounds (source size, node count, depth,
attributes per element, attribute value length, total decoded text,
images per document, table dimensions) and, if any bound is exceeded,
extracts and renders the content as **plain text** instead — never a
partially-sanitized tree. This is a correctness/availability trade-off
specific to a mobile client's memory and render-cost constraints; web
has no equivalent ceiling.

**Workaround:** none needed for realistically-authored survey content —
the defaults are generous (256KB source, 5000 nodes, 512KB of text,
etc.). If legitimate content is hitting a bound, treat it as a signal to
simplify the HTML rather than expecting the same rendering as web.
